  <p>I love to Dance its really fun. Ive been dancing for almost 14 years. I started when I was two years old. Ive known the people at my studio for my whole life. All of my sisters dance. I dance two times a week which is not as much as I would like but it is better than nothing. I love dancing because it sets my mind off of things. I enjoy doing it and I have a lots of fun. I really love to perform in front of an audience its a really good expirience. My goal is to become a better dancer and improve my skills. </p>
